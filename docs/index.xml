      <description>GitHub Flavored Markdown is the principal creation tool for slide content within PITCHME.md. This is the same tool you use as a developer to create project READMEs or Wikis for your Git repos.
The Mastering Markdown Guide is a good resource to learn or refresh the basic usage of Markdown and the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions.
 Use slide delimiters in your PITCHME.md file to split your markdown content across different slides.</description>

      <description>GitPitch offers a wide range of slideshow settings that can be used to customize the overall look-and-feel and behavior of any presentation.
To activate custom settings for your slideshow presentation, add a PITCHME.yaml properties file alongside the PITCHME.md file in your repo. Custom settings are optional.
 Note, if you are creating slide decks within private Git repos see the Publishing Guide for important details about access control policies within your PITCHME.</description>

      <description>When you develop slide content using GitPitch markdown you benefit from automatic layout of that content. The default layout policy centers content on your slides. However, if you ever want to change that default layout policy for your slide deck you can activate a custom layout policy in your PITCHME.yaml .
The following screenshot demonstrates the set of available automatic layout policies:
While these automatic layout policies are a great way to get started, GitPitch is unique among markdown presentation solutions in offering support for custom slide layouts.</description>
